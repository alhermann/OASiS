"""Kratos catalog honesty: the availability-probe stubs were REMOVED.

The old specialized.py shipped ~20 generators that only import-checked a Kratos
sub-application (not installable in this stack) and wrote {"note":"not installed"}
with no solve. The overhaul removed them rather than ship fakes. This test pins
that invariant: those keys must NOT be advertised, and no surviving Kratos
generator may be an availability-probe stub.
