"""A fixture's key must name the claim it actually exercises.

WHY, and it is not hypothetical
-------------------------------
The runner key is the ONLY link between a piece of evidence and the claim it
defends. Nothing else connects them, so when the key is wrong the failure is
completely silent: the claim looks covered, the evidence points elsewhere, and
every test still passes.

Both halves of that have happened here, in the same week:

  * FEBio — three of its six pre-existing fixtures were keyed to the wrong
    claim. `missing_control_silent_zero_result` executed the dropped-<Control>
    claim while pointing at the Poisson-ratio claim, and the catalog
    self-consistency gate sat on index 0, which made the real
    `linear_elasticity#0` claim appear covered by something that never touched
    it. Two claims defended by nothing, two others credited twice.
  * Kratos — moving 53 entries out of the pitfall lists SHIFTED INDICES, which
    would have repointed 18 fixtures at the wrong claims. They were renumbered
    atomically, and a second pass then caught that the prose in each fixture's
    `_comment` still quoted the OLD index — the human-readable evidence record
    disagreeing with the machine-readable field, which is the half that
    misleads a person reading the file.

So this gate answers one question per fixture: does the claim your key names
exist? It cannot tell whether the fixture exercises the RIGHT claim — only a
reader comparing the fixture to the entry can do that — but it catches every
key that points at nothing, which is the failure that made a claim look
defended when it was not.

It also protects the coverage metric. `covers` lists let one fixture attest to
several claims, which is correct (DUNE JIT-compiles per form, so splitting
claims that share a module buys build time and no evidence). But an unchecked
`covers` list is a coverage number anyone can raise by inventing keys, and the
freeze criterion reads that number.

    Exactly how FEBio's count was wrong: the self-consistency gate sat on
    index 0 alongside the real fixture for it, so one claim was credited twice
    while another had nothing.

    WHY THIS NO LONGER FORBIDS SHARING OUTRIGHT
    -------------------------------------------
    It used to, on the stated grounds that sharing "credits them twice and
    leaves others uncounted". The first half is not true of this tree:
    `scripts/report_tier2_claim_coverage.py` collapses to DISTINCT claim texts
    before counting and reports duplicates separately, so two fixtures on one
    claim inflate nothing. The second half is the real risk, and it is a
    property of MIS-KEYING, not of sharing.

    And sharing is sometimes correct. Two live examples, both checked against
    the claim text rather than assumed:

      * `kratos::dem::13` is a COMPOUND claim — "Kratos DEM is NOT 3D-only …
        there is no SphericParticle2D" — and two fixtures establish its two
        halves: that CylinderParticle2D constructs, and that SphericParticle2D
        is not registered.
      * `coupling::precice_coupled_run::18` is one verdict attacked from three
        angles: that only 2 of 7 backends' "CAN — proven by a real coupled
        run" was ever proven, the strong two-participant run through the
        registered tool, and the SPARTA run that settles a contradiction.

    Re-keying any of those to a free index would make it assert it tests
    something it does not — the exact defect this file exists to catch.

    So the rule is now: sharing must be DECLARED and MUTUAL. Each fixture in a
    clash lists the others in `co_defends`. An accidental clash — the FEBio
    case — still fails, because a mis-keyed fixture does not know who it
    collided with.
