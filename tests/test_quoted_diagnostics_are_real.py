"""A quoted error message must be one the software actually prints.

WHY THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT GATE IN THE SUITE
------------------------------------------------
Every verification pass that EXECUTED knowledge rather than reading it came back
with the same largest category of defect, on every backend:

    FEBio    25 invented error messages, 11 non-existent material names
    4C       a majority of quoted diagnostics not found in the source tree
             (see ON PRECISION below before quoting any rate — the first
             version of this screen reported 91% and the figure was wrong)
    NGSolve  "Newton did not converge after N iterations" — nowhere in
             ngsolve/netgen; the real text is "Warning: Newton might not
             converge! Error = "
    skfem    meshio "Cannot write complex array" — never emitted; the real
             failure is KeyError: dtype('complex128')
    Kratos   FREESTREAM_VELOCITY / MACH_INFINITY — neither name exists
    scipy    cg "raises RuntimeError: matrix not positive definite" — scipy
             raises nothing; it returns info=1000 and a garbage vector

A fabricated diagnostic is worse than a missing entry, because an agent uses the
quoted string to BUILD ITS GUARD. Told that cg raises, it writes an exception
handler and reads the absence of an exception as success — the guard passes and
the wrong answer flows through, wearing a checkmark. The knowledge does not
merely fail to help; it manufactures false confidence, which is the exact
failure this project exists to prevent.

`audit_phantom_apis.py` checks API ATTRIBUTES via hasattr. It says nothing about
message text, which is where the damage has actually been.

HOW THIS AVOIDS CRYING WOLF
---------------------------
Two earlier guards here were too eager and had to be retracted — a delegation
guard flagged `sorted`, `dedent` and `format` (about 20 false accusations), and
a disclosure guard failed five honest 4C entries over a phrasing difference. An
ignored gate protects nothing, so this one is deliberately conservative, and
each rule below exists because the naive version produced a false accusation on
the real corpus:

  * dependency trees are searched too, since genuine messages come from
    Trilinos, PETSc, UMFPACK, meshio and scipy as well as from the backend;
  * matching is on the longest STATIC fragment, because real messages
    interpolate at runtime;
  * quotes are paired left to right — an alternation regex straddled from one
    fragment's closing quote to the next one's opening quote and "found" prose;
  * RETRACTIONS ARE EXEMPT. When a pass falsifies a string, the honest fix
    records what the entry used to claim. Flagging that would punish exactly
    the behaviour we want;
  * a backend whose source cannot be found reports UNKNOWN, never ABSENT —
    "could not verify" and "verified absent" are different claims and only one
    is an accusation.

def test_the_screen_still_catches_a_fabrication_after_widening():
    """MUTATION CONTROL for the screen itself. It must fail on invented text.

    Every fix that stops a false accusation also makes this screen more
    permissive, and a screen that has been widened until it accuses nobody
    protects nothing. So the widening has to be paid for in the other
    direction, measured, on every change.

    That is not hypothetical here. Tightening FEniCSx cost four separate
    loosenings — the exception-class strip, the MPI rank strip, a suffix
    search and a printf-template probe — and the FIRST version of the suffix
    search waved through three of twelve inventions on the strength of a
    generic English tail:

        "solver exploded during the quadrature loop"
                        excused by <= "the quadrature loop"

    None of the three is emitted by anything. Requiring the skipped head to be
    a SINGLE token — the shape of a substituted name, not a run of prose —
    recovered all three while keeping nanobind's genuine
    `create_matrix(): incompatible function arguments`.

    Both directions are asserted, because either alone is satisfiable by a
    degenerate screen: one that flags everything, or one that flags nothing.
