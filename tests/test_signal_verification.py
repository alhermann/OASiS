"""Signal-clause verification regression test.

Establishes a floor for the quality of `Signal:` clauses in the
pitfall DB so the project cannot ship a worse claim than what is
shipped today. The harness in `scripts/verify_signal_clauses.py`
computes the metrics; this test asserts none of them regress.

This is the merge-gate the senior-AI-scientist critic (2026-05-31)
called for as the second-largest risk (Signal: clauses are an
unfalsifiable contract — make them at least falsifiable).

What this test does NOT do: claim every signal is real (Tier 2,
intentional-failure regression fixtures, is multi-week work). It
establishes Tier 0 (Signal references a real entity in the
canonical catalogs) and Tier 1 (Signal uses observable-symptom
vocabulary) as the falsifiability floor.

    # rolled back. All five new fixtures printed
    # "<key>=skipped_no_binary" and returned 0 when febio4 was

    # prefix, which that skip string satisfies. On any host without
    # FEBio the five rows were therefore green while verifying
    # nothing: the floor certified five checks that had not run. A
    # floor that certifies nothing is worse than no floor, because it
    # is read as evidence.
    #
    # Repair, applied to all five fixture directories:
    #   * a missing binary now prints "FAIL: ..." and returns 1
    #     ("FAIL:" is already in every fixture's forbid_in_output, so
    #     the failure is recorded even if the exit status is ignored),
    #   * expect_in_output pins the success TOKEN, not the key prefix
    #     (e.g. "febio_patch_test=passed",
    #     "unknown_module_segfault_count=4"), so no skip string can
    #     satisfy it,
    #   * "skipped_no_binary" was added to forbid_in_output.
    # Verified both ways on this host: all five pass with febio4
    # present and all five fail with FEBIO_BINARY pointing at a
    # non-existent path.

    Backed by scripts/audit_backend_imports.py — that script is
    the source of truth; this test compares its live output
    against the baseline recorded 2026-06-01.

    Baseline values capture the install reality on the user's
    machine at audit time. If the user installs the missing
    Kratos apps (KratosConstitutiveLawsApplication, DEM, MPM,
    Iga, etc.) the Kratos-available count goes up and the
    unreachable count goes down — bump the baseline downward in
    that direction. NEVER bump it UP without explicit signoff:
    a regression here means an install broke or a physics
    started depending on something that isn't available.
