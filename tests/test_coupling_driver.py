# ── the stochastic branch: a residual floor that is MEASURED, not assumed ────
#
# A Monte-Carlo participant answers the same question slightly differently every
# time, so the residual — which is the CHANGE in the export — cannot fall below
# that scatter however well the coupling has converged. A `tol` under the floor
# is unreachable by construction and every run of a correct coupling was
# reported as a failure. These use a noisy participant with a seed drawn per
# invocation, so they exercise the real mechanism with no solver involved.

# SEED=None keeps the original behaviour: a fresh draw per invocation, which is
# what a real Monte-Carlo participant does. SEED=<int> makes the sequence
# reproducible WITHOUT making it constant — the participant is a fresh process
# every iteration, so it advances a counter on disk and seeds with SEED+n. The
# residual trajectory is then noisy but identical from run to run.
#
# A test that asserts a message about a residual TRAJECTORY needs the
# trajectory to be fixed. With a fresh draw, whether the residual had actually
# plateaued by iteration 25 varied per run, so the assertion sampled the noise
# rather than testing the message, and failed roughly one run in ten.
