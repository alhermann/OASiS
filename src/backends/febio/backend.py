Specialized for soft tissue mechanics, biphasic/multiphasic problems, and
biological applications.

    "assembled the way INTERNAL forces are, so <force>f</force> applies a "
    "physical body force of MINUS f, and it is a SPECIFIC force: the value is "
    "multiplied by the material's <density>, so the same number means "
    "different loads in different materials. Measured on this install: the "
    "deck route and an equivalent consistent nodal load agree to 1e-15 ONLY "
    "after negating the deck value. "
    "Two further limits. type=\"const\" and \"non-const\" are FEBio-2 "
    "classes that FEBio 4 still registers but marks obsolete since 3.0 — the "
    "current name is \"body force\". And the parameter is ONE vec3 for the "
    "whole domain: a math string cannot make it vary per element, so a "
    "POSITION-DEPENDENT source (any manufactured solution, any polynomial "
    "load) cannot be written in the deck at all. Compute the consistent nodal "
    "load vector F_i = int b.phi_i dV yourself and apply it as a nodal_force "
    "map — data/coupling_participants/participant_febio_elastic.py does "
    "exactly this, with Gauss quadrature over the hex8 elements. "
    "THE DOOR THROUGH THIS WALL, because one agent read the paragraph above "
    "as 'FEBio cannot do this problem' and abandoned a solvable task: a load "
    "of the form f(x,y)*g(t) — and every manufactured solution's source in "
    "practice factors this way or is a short sum of such terms — needs NO "
    "time-varying deck mechanism at all. Put the SPATIAL part f(x,y) into the "
    "consistent nodal load map (computed once, as above), and put the TIME "
    "part g(t) into the load controller curve that scales the map: "
    "<load_controller type=\"loadcurve\"> with <points> sampling g(t) at "
    "each output time, interpolate LINEAR (or SMOOTH for C1). That is the "
    "standard FEBio idiom — the shipped participant's LoadData block does "
    "exactly this. A sum of separable terms is one nodal_load per term, each "
    "with its own curve. 'The deck cannot express it' is true only of a "
    "genuinely non-separable f(x,y,t), and even there a per-timestep restart "
    "loop works before you declare a task impossible. "
    "If you take that route, remember FEBio's reported reaction Rx/Ry is "
    "m_Fr, accumulated only on the ELEMENT path: FENodalLoad::LoadVector "
    "calls the scalar Assemble(), which at a prescribed dof adds to nothing. "
    "So a nodal load never reaches the reported reaction, and any use of "
    "r = A u - b must subtract the consistent load itself. Skipping that "
    "correction leaves a spurious FIRST-ORDER error in a recovered traction "
    "that is otherwise exact.")
