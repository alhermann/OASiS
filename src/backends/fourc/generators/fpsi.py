"""Fluid-Porous-Structure Interaction (FPSI) generator for 4C.

Covers coupling of a free fluid domain (Navier-Stokes) with a porous medium
(Darcy/Biot) and a deformable solid structure.  The fluid-porous interface
uses Beavers-Joseph-Saffman conditions while the porous-structure interface
ensures kinematic compatibility.  Applications include geomechanics,
biological tissue perfusion, and filtration systems.
