"""Kratos auxiliary applications — utility, infrastructure, and legacy apps.

These do not own their own physics problem types, so they have no
GENERATORS — but the agent needs to know about them because other
generators reference them (e.g. FSI pulls in MappingApplication;
parallel runs need TrilinosApplication + MetisApplication; HDF5
output needs HDF5Application).

MetisApplication does have a PyPI wheel (KratosMetisApplication), but it is only useful in an MPI-parallel run. Signal: `import KratosMultiphysics.TrilinosApplication` raises ModuleNotFoundError and the package index offers no KratosTrilinosApplication distribution at any version, while KratosMetisApplication does resolve \u2014 the failure is one wheel's absence, not a broken stack.",
            "[Integration] MappingApplication and MeshMovingApplication are *required* (not optional) for partitioned FSI even if not named explicitly in the user-facing JSON \u2014 `FSIApplication`'s `partitioned_fsi_base_solver.py` imports both at runtime. Signal: the run fails inside FSIApplication's partitioned_fsi_base_solver on `import KratosMultiphysics.MappingApplication` or `...MeshMovingApplication` \u2014 a ModuleNotFoundError naming an application the user never wrote in the JSON, not an error on their own import line.",
            "[Numerical] For new analyses prefer StructuralMechanicsApplication and ContactStructuralMechanicsApplication over the older SolidMechanicsApplication / ContactMechanicsApplication paths; the current Kratos generators target the modern apps. Signal: `import KratosMultiphysics.SolidMechanicsApplication` and `...ContactMechanicsApplication` raise ModuleNotFoundError on a pip stack while the modern pair imports \u2014 the older path is unreachable, not merely discouraged.",
            "[API] MappingApplication.MapperFactory is DEPRECATED (moved to KratosMultiphysics core in Kratos 10.x). Calling MAP.MapperFactory.CreateMapper still works in 10.4 but prints a deprecation warning: \"[WARNING] DEPRECATION-Warning; MappingApplication: The \\\"MapperFactory\\\" was moved to the Core! (used for \\\"CreateMapper\\\")\". New code should use `KratosMultiphysics.MapperFactory.CreateMapper(origin, destination, params)` directly. Signal: KratosMultiphysics emits the literal string 'DEPRECATION-Warning' + 'MapperFactory' + 'moved to the Core' on stderr at the call site. (Verified empirically 2026-06-01.)",
            "[API] There is no SphericParticle2D, but Kratos DEM is NOT 3D-only — the 2D particle is registered under the Cylinder* stem. Use CylinderParticle2D (or CylinderContinuumParticle2D for bonded 2D), with the 2D discontinuum law DEM_D_Hertz_viscous_Coulomb2D. Signal: CreateNewElement('SphericParticle2D', ...) raises RuntimeError 'The Element \"SphericParticle2D\" is not registered!' and lists the available DEM element types, while CreateNewElement('CylinderParticle2D', ...) on the same model part succeeds. (Verified by execution 2026-08-07 on a build carrying DEMApplication — corrects the earlier 'DEM is always 3D internally' claim, which mis-advised a 3D sphere with constrained out-of-plane DOFs.)",

(Those constants are this repo's own Python names, not Kratos variables; none of them is a key you write into a deck.)
