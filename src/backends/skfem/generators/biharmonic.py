# Morley carries two kinds of dof: a value at each vertex and a normal
# derivative at each edge midpoint. .flatten() returns BOTH (on a refined unit
# square: 16 nodal + 16 facet = 32), so it clamps. Taking .nodal_ix leaves the
# normal derivative free, which is simple support. This comment used to say
# "simply supported" above the clamped call — the two differ by a boundary
# layer and by the constant in the error, not by an error message, so nothing
# would have told you.
