"""
SPARTA backend — Stochastic PArallel Rarefied-gas Time-accurate Analyzer (Sandia).

SPARTA is a Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) particle code for rarefied gas
dynamics — a fundamentally different paradigm from the FEM backends: it solves the
Boltzmann equation stochastically with simulator particles + probabilistic collisions,
which no continuum FEM solver can do. This makes SPARTA the particle half of genuinely
forced multi-paradigm couplings (e.g. DSMC gas <-> FEM solid conjugate heat transfer via
preCICE).

Knowledge layout (restructured): the agent-facing knowledge lives in
``generators/``, one module per physics, each exposing a KNOWLEDGE dict whose
pitfalls carry an observable ``Signal:`` clause plus parameterised deck
generators — the same shape the FEM backends use. ``sparta_knowledge.json``
remains the verbatim SPARTA documentation index (121 doc pages) and the bundled
upstream example decks; it is a LOOKUP table for validate_input and for
on-demand syntax queries, not something pushed at the agent on every call.
