"""Did the named codes actually run, and did they actually couple?

The pre-existing gate (``grade_blind.code_ran``) is a case-insensitive
**substring** scan for the code's name over every ``.log/.out/.txt/.json`` under
the run directory, excluding four filenames.  The task statement names both
codes.  So an agent that writes any note mentioning "deal.II" satisfies the
deal.II evidence requirement without deal.II existing on the machine.

Combine that with a coupled instance whose two subdomains carry the same field
and the same material, and the rational strategy for either arm is: solve the
whole problem monolithically in one code, write a file mentioning the second,
submit.  The result converges at order two, passes every integrity gate, and the
cell has measured single-code PDE solving — which the single-code cells already
measure.  A coupling-uplift number computed from that would be believed and
empty.

What this module requires instead
---------------------------------
1. **Structured solver output, per code.**  Not the code's name: a line only
   that solver emits, carrying a NUMBER it computed.  ``dolfinx`` printing a DOF
   count, deal.II's "Number of active cells", NGSolve's ``ndof``, Kratos's
   solver banner with a time.  A name is prose; a number is a run.

2. **The two codes' evidence must come from different files.**  One monolithic
   solve writes one solver's output.  This does not stop a determined forger,
   and is not claimed to.

3. **A partitioned-iteration residual history, as a required artefact.**  A
   coupled run that cannot produce one did not couple.  It must have at least
   three iterations, be positive, decrease by at least a factor of ten from
   first to last, end at or below the interface tolerance the task prescribed,
   and agree with the iteration count the agent reports in ``RESULT.txt``.
   A monolithic solve has no such history at all.

Honesty about what this is
--------------------------
This raises the cost of faking from "write one text file" to "implement a
plausible partitioned iteration and log it".  It is not proof of execution and
is not described as such.  The verdicts are three-valued — ``PROVEN``,
``NOT_PROVEN``, ``CONTRADICTED`` — because a gate that can only say yes or no
forces an unproven run to be scored as either fabricated or fine, and it is
neither.

# THE CANONICAL LINE, ACCEPTED FOR EVERY CODE.
#
# The per-code table above knows a different phrasing per solver, and that is a
# bias, not a feature: NGSolve prints `ndof` and scikit-fem prints `n_dofs`, so
# both matched, while an honest dolfinx run that printed the same quantity in its
# own words did not, and graded FABRICATED_NO_RUN. Which arm that falls on
# depends only on which code the arm happened to use.
#
# So every task text now REQUIRES one canonical, number-bearing line per
# participant per level -- `NDOF = <integer>` in run_level<k>_<side>.log -- and
# the gate accepts it for every code. Two halves of one contract: the gate
# without the instruction fails quiet honest runs, and the instruction without
# the gate is ignored.
#
# WHAT IT COSTS. A canonical line does not say WHICH code wrote it, so on its own
# it no longer distinguishes two runs from one. That weight moves to the two
# checks that were already carrying it: `assess` reports when both codes' only
# evidence is the same file, and the partitioned-iteration residual history --
# which a monolithic solve cannot produce at all -- is required separately.
