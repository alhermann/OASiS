"""Campaign-3 blind runner.

Executes one agent per (problem, model, condition, seed) on a BLIND task and
records everything needed for cost and energy accounting. It deliberately does
NOT grade: grading happens afterwards, offline, with grade_blind.py, which is
the only component that opens a sealed key.

Safety properties:
  * the answer keys are sealed (unreadable) while this runs — the runner
    refuses to start otherwise;
  * every run gets a fresh directory and an existing ledger is never
    overwritten (a relaunch resumes and fills gaps);
  * tokens in/out, wall time and tool calls are recorded per run;
  * the live trajectory is written as it happens, so a crash or timeout cannot
    destroy the evidence the leak audit needs.

Usage:
  ../../open-fem-agent/.venv-lg/bin/python run_blind.py \
      --model 27b --conditions BARE MCP --problems B1 B2 D1 --seed 0
